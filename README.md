# Integration-Blueprints
Repository containing the sample code used in the Integration Blueprints showing how to integrate Sitecore products with each other, and also with 3rd party systems.
Each Integration Blueprint can be found listed below.

## Samples Included
 - [Sitecore XM & Sitecore CDP]("/Sitecore%20XM%20%26%20Sitecore%20CDP/")

## Support
None of the code here is supported by Sitecore, they are code samples to be implemented by Sitecore's Partners & Customers. Github Issues are accepted but there is no commitment to resolving issues. Sitecore will respond to them as time permits.

## Contributions
While contributions are welcome, please read the [Contributing Guide]("CONTRIBUTING.md") first.
